## Thanks
Thank you to [Francesco Carlucci](https://github.com/FrancescoCarlucci/) for the idea that prompted this plugin, and to [Otto](http://ottopress.com/) for the base Pluginception plugin.

Thank you to Liam Baily for the [base template](https://github.com/LiamBailey/wordpress-plugin-simple-boilerplate) that was modified to produce this. This uses my updated fork, found [here](https://github.com/duplaja/wordpress-plugin-simple-boilerplate).
